# LinuxProgramming

I created this repository to teach system programming in Linux. \
I will be using the TLPI book by Michael Kerrisk. \
Most of the prepared code examples belong to the author of the book and will be. \
I will use them in the learning process to diagnose errors in system calls and command line arguments: 

- Build_ename.sh 
- ename.c.inc 
- error_functions.h 
- error_functions.c 
- get_num.c 
- get_num.h 
- tlpi_hdr.h
